# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
### The purpose of this challenge is to be able to predict whether a loan apllicant is low risk or high risk using supervised machine learning. To better explain, we will take the data that has been given and tell us if an applicant has been determined to low or high risk and train our application to make its own predictions.
## Results:
* Naive Random Oversampling Results: The accuracy for this is at 65.7%. The precision for high risk is low and is high for low risk. The recall is at .63 for high risk and .6 for low risk.

* SMOTE Oversampling Results: The accuracy for SMOTE oversampling is 66.2%.  The precision for high risk is low and is high for low risk. The recall is at .71 for high risk and .69 for low risk.
